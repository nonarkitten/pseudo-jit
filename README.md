# The Buffee Accelerator

PJIT is part of [the Buffee Project](https://www.buffee.ca). The hardware can be viewed [here](https://oshwlab.com/Renee/buffee-accelerator).

## Building

Download a copy of Code Composer Studio 10 (this might be buildable with GCC directly, but I'm not bothering with that right now). Git clone this into your workspace and then import it. You should be able to compile and debug from there.
